To ensure copyright, integrity, and security of digital color images, we propose a blind watermarking method utilizing Discrete Hankel Transform (DHT) and Hadamard Transform. By initially encrypting the color watermark image using Lorenz chaotic mapping, we achieve maximum energy concentration in the image matrix through two-stage frequency domain transformations: DHT followed by Hadamard Transform. The watermark information is embedded and extracted at the position of maximum energy concentration using quantization index modulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent invisibility .
The code for embedding and extracting the watermark is located in the Experimental code folder, where you can find detailed descriptions of the code implementation. In this experiment, we used the host image in the host image folder, and the watermarked image in the watermarked folder.
