To ensure copyright, integrity, and security of digital color images, we propose a blind watermarking method utilizing Discrete Hankel Transform (DHT) and Hadamard Transform. By initially encrypting the color watermark image using Lorenz chaotic mapping, we achieve maximum energy concentration in the image matrix through two-stage frequency domain transformations: DHT followed by Hadamard Transform. The watermark information is embedded and extracted at the position of maximum energy concentration using quantization index modulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent invisibility .
The code for embedding and extracting watermarks is located in the "Experimental Code" folder, where you can find detailed code implementation instructions. In this experiment, we used the host image located in the "Host Image" folder and the watermark image located in the "Watermark Image" folder. The Experimental Procedure document explains the specific process of watermark embedding and extraction, and the DHT function folder introduces the relevant code for the discrete Hankel transform used in this experiment.
