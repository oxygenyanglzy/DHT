To ensure copyright, integrity, and security of digital color images, we propose a blind watermarking method utilizing Discrete Hankel Transform (DHT) and Hadamard Transform. By initially encrypting the color watermark image using Lorenz chaotic mapping, we achieve maximum energy concentration in the image matrix through two-stage frequency domain transformations: DHT followed by Hadamard Transform. The watermark information is embedded and extracted at the position of maximum energy concentration using quantization index modulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent invisibility .
The main function for execution and the attack tests  can be found in "DHTmain.m".
